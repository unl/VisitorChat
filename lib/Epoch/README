This is an attempt to make a very lightweight php PSR-0 complient framework based on Savvy, Regexp Router, and a simple active record class.  Using these three things we have
everything we need to start a very customizible application, with little start up time.

To get started, do the following:
1) set up your config file.
2) call the following code:
        $app = new \App\Controller($_GET);
        echo $app->render();
3) ????
4) profit!

More details comming soon.
