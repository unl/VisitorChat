    <dd>
        <p>Currently, in order to set up your site in the chat system, you will need to send an email to <a href='mailto:s-mfairch4@gmail.com'>Michael Fairchild</a>.
            The email should contain the following information.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The URL of the site that you want to set up.</li>
                <li>Names of personal that will be answering chats.</li>
                <li>The role for each person.  Possible chat roles include Operator (can only answer chats) and Manager (can answer chats and view site history)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>We are working on automating this setup process, however that work is not yet completed.</p>

    <dt id='shownicon'>Why does my site show up have chat enabled and I have not set it up?</dt>
    <dd><p>Chances are your site isn't defined in the <a href='http://www1.unl.edu/wdn/registry/'>WDN Registry</a> yet.
        Please visit the registry to ensure that your site is defined.  Please note that any changes made in the registry can take up to 24 hours to take effect in the chat system.</p></dd>
    
    <dt id='features'>What are some features of the chat system?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The chat system allows visitors to UNL templated web pages to chat with site personal as defined in the WDN Registry.  Some features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Once a visitor starts a conversation, it will follow them to any UNL templated web page.</li>
                <li>New conversations will be routed to an operator that can help with the site that client started the conversation on.</li>
                <li>Operators can see where the conversation was started, the ip, browser name and operating system name of the client.</li>
                <li>Operators can view past conversations that they have taken part in.</li>
                <li>Managers can view all conversations for their site.</li>
                <li>Conversations are routed intelligently, so that if all operators for the site fail to answer the conversation, the next nearest site will be asked to answer the conversation instead.</li>
                <li>Operators can configure how many conversations they can handle at any given time.</li>
            </ul>
    </dd>
    
    <dt id='cost'>How much does the chat system cost?</dt>
    <dd><p>The chat system is free for any UNL site.</p></dd>
    
    <dt id='notifications'>How do I turn on notifications?</dt>
    <dd><p>The chat system includes several kinds of notifications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sound notifications.</li>
            <li>Page title notifications (the page title will flash when there is a new alert).</li>
            <li>Desktop notification support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Desktop notifications can only be used when the operator is using Google Chrome (currently the only browser that supports desktop notifications).
            If you are using google chrome, you can enable desktop notifications in the settings page.
