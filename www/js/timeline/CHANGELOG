CHAP Links Library - Timeline


2012-09-18, version 2.3.2

  time, which did only work in the axis area but not in the contents area.


2012-09-13, version 2.3.1

- added: double tap events on mobile devices will now fire the edit/new event.
- fixed/updated example 09, 15, 17, and 18.
- created example 21.


2012-09-05, version 2.3.0

- new: items can now have an individual class name which allows styling of
  individual items. This gives a lot of extra flexibility.
- fixed issue #26: pinching on Ipad did throw an error "ReferenceError: Can't
  find variable: timeline".

  but move the timeline slightly (less than 1px).

- fixed the 'select' event not being fired when an item gets unselected.
- fixed method changeItem not dealing with changing the type of the item
  from box to range or vice versa.


2012-07-27, version 2.2.0

- added an option showMinorLabels. By setting both showMinorLabels and

- fixed issue #6: items and axis did not move with the speed when moving
  the Timeline under IE8 and older.
- fixed issue #8: start, end, min, max not working correctly around Date(0).
- fixed issue #9. It is now possible to specify only start or end in the
  options, instead of having to specify both.

  change.
